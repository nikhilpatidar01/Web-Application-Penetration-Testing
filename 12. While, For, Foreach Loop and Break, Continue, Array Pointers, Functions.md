## 1. while Loop

### What is `while` Loop?

The `while` loop in PHP executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.

### Use Case:

Use a `while` loop when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition.

### Full Code Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
$count = 0;
while ($count <= 10) {
    echo $count . ",";
    $count++;
}

echo "<br />";
echo $count;
?>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of Code:

* `$var` is initialized to 1.
* The `while` loop runs as long as `$var` is less than or equal to 5.
* Each iteration prints the current value and increments `$var` by 1.

---

## 2. for Loop

### What is `for` Loop?

The `for` loop repeats a block of code a specific number of times.

### Use Case:

Use a `for` loop when the number of iterations is known in advance.

### Full Code Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Even or Odd Checker</title>
</head>
<body>
    <?php
  echo "<h2>PHP While Loop Output (0 to 10):</h2>";
echo "<p>";
$count = 0;
while ($count <= 10) {
    echo $count . ", ";
    $count++;
}
echo "</p>";

echo "<h2>PHP For Loop Output (Even or Odd from 0 to 20):</h2>";
for ($i = 0; $i <= 20; $i++) {
    if ($i % 2 == 0) {
        echo "<p>$i is Even.</p>";
    } else {
        echo "<p>$i is Odd.</p>";
    }
}
?>
</body>
</html>

```

### Explanation of Code:

* `$var` is initialized to 1.
* The loop runs while `$var` is less than or equal to 5.
* `$var` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.

## 3. foreach Loop

### What is `foreach` Loop?

The `foreach` loop is used to iterate over elements in an array.

### Use Case:

Use `foreach` to easily access each value in an array one-by-one.

### Full Code Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Even or Odd Checker</title>
</head>
<body>
    <?php
        $array1 = array(20, 25, 78, 45, 96, 21);
 
        // Looping through value only
        foreach ($array1 as $num) {
            echo $num . ", ";
        }
        echo "<br />";

        // Looping through key-value pairs
        foreach ($array1 as $key => $value) {
            echo $key . ":" . $value . "<br />";
        }

        $users = array(
            'id' => 2,
            'Name' => 'Nikhil',
            'Email' => 'nikhilpatidar132@gmail.com',
            'Password' => 'nikhil@123'
        );

        // Associative Array key-value loop
        foreach ($users as $key => $value) {
            echo $key . ":" . $value . "<br />";
        }

        echo $users['id'] . "<br />";

        // Conditional loop based on value
        foreach ($users as $key => $value) {
            if ($users['id'] == 1) {
                echo $key . ":" . $value . "<br />";
            }
        }
    ?>
</body>
</html>

```

### Explanation of Code:

* The array `$numbers` contains a list of integers.
* The `foreach` loop assigns each value to `$var` and prints it.

## 4. break and continue

### What is `break` and `continue`?

* `break`: Exits the loop immediately.
* `continue`: Skips the current iteration and jumps to the next one.

### Use Case:

* Use `break` to stop the loop based on a condition.
* Use `continue` to skip specific values without stopping the entire loop.

### Full Code Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
// Basic for loop
echo "<h3>Basic Loop (0 to 10):</h3>";
for ($i = 0; $i <= 10; $i++) {
    echo $i . ", ";
}
echo "<br/><br/>";

// Using continue to skip value 5
echo "<h3>Using continue (Skip 5):</h3>";
for ($i = 0; $i <= 10; $i++) {
    if ($i == 5) {
        continue;
    }
    echo $i . ", ";
}
echo "<br/><br/>";

// Using break to stop loop at 5
echo "<h3>Using break (Stop at 5):</h3>";
for ($i = 0; $i <= 10; $i++) {
    if ($i == 5) {
        break;
    }
    echo $i . ", ";
}
?>

</body>
</html>

```

### Explanation of Code:

* The first loop stops when `$var` is equal to 4 due to `break`.
* The second loop skips the iteration when `$var` is 3 due to `continue`, but continues running for the rest.

## 5. Array Pointers

### What is an Array Pointer?

Array pointer functions are used to manually navigate through array elements in PHP.

### Use Case:

Use pointer functions when you need to control or track the current position in an array.

### Full Code Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
$numbers = [100, 200, 300, 400];

echo "Current: " . current($numbers) . "<br>";
echo "Next: " . next($numbers) . "<br>";
echo "Next: " . next($numbers) . "<br>";
echo "Previous: " . prev($numbers) . "<br>";
echo "End: " . end($numbers) . "<br>";
echo "Reset: " . reset($numbers) . "<br>";
?>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of Code:

* `current()` returns the first element.
* `next()` moves the pointer forward and returns the next element.
* `prev()` moves the pointer one step back.
* `end()` moves the pointer to the last element.
* `reset()` resets the pointer back to the first element.

## 6. Functions

### What is a Function?

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

### Use Case:

Use functions to group code that needs to be reused multiple times with different values.

### Full Code Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
function square($var) {
    $result = $var * $var;
    echo "Square of $var is $result <br>";
}

square(2);
square(4);
square(6);
?>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of Code:

* The `square()` function takes a number as input and prints its square.
* The function is called three times with different values of `$var`.
