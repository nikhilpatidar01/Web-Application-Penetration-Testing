## 1. while Loop

### What is `while` Loop?

The `while` loop in PHP executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.

### Use Case:

Use a `while` loop when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition.

### Full Code Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
$var = 1;
while ($var <= 5) {
    echo "Value: $var <br>";
    $var++;
}
?>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of Code:

* `$var` is initialized to 1.
* The `while` loop runs as long as `$var` is less than or equal to 5.
* Each iteration prints the current value and increments `$var` by 1.

---

## 2. for Loop

### What is `for` Loop?

The `for` loop repeats a block of code a specific number of times.

### Use Case:

Use a `for` loop when the number of iterations is known in advance.

### Full Code Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
for ($var = 1; $var <= 5; $var++) {
    echo "Count: $var <br>";
}
?>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of Code:

* `$var` is initialized to 1.
* The loop runs while `$var` is less than or equal to 5.
* `$var` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.

---

## 3. foreach Loop

### What is `foreach` Loop?

The `foreach` loop is used to iterate over elements in an array.

### Use Case:

Use `foreach` to easily access each value in an array one-by-one.

### Full Code Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
$numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

foreach ($numbers as $var) {
    echo "Number: $var <br>";
}
?>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of Code:

* The array `$numbers` contains a list of integers.
* The `foreach` loop assigns each value to `$var` and prints it.

---

## 4. break and continue

### What is `break` and `continue`?

* `break`: Exits the loop immediately.
* `continue`: Skips the current iteration and jumps to the next one.

### Use Case:

* Use `break` to stop the loop based on a condition.
* Use `continue` to skip specific values without stopping the entire loop.

### Full Code Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
for ($var = 1; $var <= 5; $var++) {
    if ($var == 4) {
        break;
    }
    echo "Break Example: $var <br>";
}

echo "<hr>";

for ($var = 1; $var <= 5; $var++) {
    if ($var == 3) {
        continue;
    }
    echo "Continue Example: $var <br>";
}
?>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of Code:

* The first loop stops when `$var` is equal to 4 due to `break`.
* The second loop skips the iteration when `$var` is 3 due to `continue`, but continues running for the rest.

## 5. Array Pointers

### What is an Array Pointer?

Array pointer functions are used to manually navigate through array elements in PHP.

### Use Case:

Use pointer functions when you need to control or track the current position in an array.

### Full Code Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
$numbers = [100, 200, 300, 400];

echo "Current: " . current($numbers) . "<br>";
echo "Next: " . next($numbers) . "<br>";
echo "Next: " . next($numbers) . "<br>";
echo "Previous: " . prev($numbers) . "<br>";
echo "End: " . end($numbers) . "<br>";
echo "Reset: " . reset($numbers) . "<br>";
?>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of Code:

* `current()` returns the first element.
* `next()` moves the pointer forward and returns the next element.
* `prev()` moves the pointer one step back.
* `end()` moves the pointer to the last element.
* `reset()` resets the pointer back to the first element.

## 6. Functions

### What is a Function?

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

### Use Case:

Use functions to group code that needs to be reused multiple times with different values.

### Full Code Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
function square($var) {
    $result = $var * $var;
    echo "Square of $var is $result <br>";
}

square(2);
square(4);
square(6);
?>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of Code:

* The `square()` function takes a number as input and prints its square.
* The function is called three times with different values of `$var`.
