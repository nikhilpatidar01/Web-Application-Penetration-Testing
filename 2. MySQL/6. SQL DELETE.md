# ‚ùå SQL DELETE ‚Äî Remove Records from Table

### üîß **Syntax**

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

* ‚ö†Ô∏è **No `WHERE` = all rows gone!**
* Always run a `SELECT` before `DELETE` for safety.

### üìã Show all records first

```sql
SELECT * FROM user2;
```

## üî• BASIC DELETE OPERATIONS

| ‚úÖ Task                                       | üìå Query                                            |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Delete all records                           | `DELETE FROM user2;`                                |
| Delete one user                              | `DELETE FROM user2 WHERE id = 1;`                   |
| Delete multiple users                        | `DELETE FROM user2 WHERE id IN (2, 3, 5);`          |
| Delete users with ID > 10                    | `DELETE FROM user2 WHERE id > 10;`                  |
| Delete users with ID between 5 and 10        | `DELETE FROM user2 WHERE id BETWEEN 5 AND 10;`      |
| Delete by name                               | `DELETE FROM user2 WHERE name = 'Admin';`           |
| Delete users whose name starts with 'A'      | `DELETE FROM user2 WHERE name LIKE 'A%';`           |
| Delete users whose email ends with gmail.com | `DELETE FROM user2 WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com';` |
| Delete using pattern                         | `DELETE FROM user2 WHERE name REGEXP '^n';`         |

## üö´ CONDITIONAL DELETES

```sql
DELETE FROM user2 WHERE age < 18;             -- Underage users
DELETE FROM user2 WHERE enable = 0;           -- Disabled users
DELETE FROM user2 WHERE course_name IS NULL;  -- Users with missing course
```

---

## üß† ADVANCED DELETE EXAMPLES

```sql
DELETE FROM user2
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM user2 WHERE enable = 1);
```

> Deletes users who are not enabled (‚ùó subqueries may need `JOIN` in some DBs).

## üßπ DELETE VS TRUNCATE VS DROP (üî• Quick Diff)

| Command    | What it does             | Can use WHERE? | Resets AUTO\_INCREMENT? |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| `DELETE`   | Deletes selected rows    | ‚úÖ Yes          | ‚ùå No                    |
| `TRUNCATE` | Deletes all rows fast    | ‚ùå No           | ‚úÖ Yes                   |
| `DROP`     | Deletes the entire table | ‚ùå No           | ‚úÖ Yes                   |

---

### ‚úÖ Good Practice:

```sql
-- Always preview:
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE age < 18;

-- Then delete safely:
DELETE FROM user2 WHERE age < 18;
```
