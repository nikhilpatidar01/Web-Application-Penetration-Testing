## ➕➖ Arithmetic Operators in MySQL

MySQL supports **standard arithmetic operators** for numerical calculations, including support for numeric **strings**, **columns**, and **constants**.

---

### ➕ **Addition (`+`)**

Adds two numbers.

```sql
SELECT 20 + 2;
SELECT 26 + 2 AS Total;
SELECT 20 + 2, 25 + 59, 30 + 30 AS Total;
```

🚫 **Note:** Repeating alias names will override each other:

```sql
SELECT 20 + 2 AS Total, 25 + 59 AS Total, 30 + 30 AS Total;
-- Only last "Total" column is kept
```

📌 Strings are auto-converted to numbers:

```sql
SELECT '1990' + '2080', '2005' + '2200';
```

📈 Add 4 to each student’s percentage:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email, (percentage + 4) AS new_percent FROM student;
```

---

### ➖ **Subtraction (`-`)**

Subtracts one number from another.

```sql
SELECT 20 - 2;
SELECT 26 - 15, 30 - 14;
```

📌 Strings converted to integers:

```sql
SELECT '2150' - '1550', 1200 - '200';
```

📉 Subtract 4 from each student's percentage:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email, (percentage - 4) AS adjusted_percent FROM student;
```

---

### ✖️ **Multiplication (`*`)**

Multiplies two values.

```sql
SELECT 16 * 2;
SELECT 5 * 3, 15 * 5;
SELECT 21 * '3', '250' * 5;
```

📌 Multiply each student’s percentage by 4:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email, (percentage * 4) AS boosted_percent FROM student;
```

---

### ➗ **Division (`/`)**

Performs floating-point division.

```sql
SELECT 10 / 2;
SELECT 2 / 3, 3 / 5;
SELECT 250 / '19', '1225' / 2;
```

⚠️ Division by zero returns `NULL`:

```sql
SELECT 12 / 0; -- NULL
```

📉 Divide student percentage by 4:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email, (percentage / 4) AS scaled_percent FROM student;
```

---

### 🔢 **Integer Division (`DIV`)**

Returns the **quotient** (integer part only, no decimals).

```sql
SELECT 20 DIV 3;
SELECT 5 DIV 2, 40 DIV 3, -100 DIV -7;
SELECT '220' DIV 3, 400 DIV '65';
```

📊 Integer-divide student percentage by 4:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email, (percentage DIV 4) AS quarter_percent FROM student;
```

---

### 🔁 **Modulus (`%` or `MOD()`)**

Returns the **remainder** after division.

```sql
SELECT 10 % 3;
SELECT 257 % 9, MOD(222, 19);
SELECT '2345' % 23;
```

🧮 Get the remainder of percentage divided by 4:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email, (percentage % 4) AS remainder FROM student;
```
