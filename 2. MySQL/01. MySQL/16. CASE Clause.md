## 🧠 MySQL `CASE` Clause

The `CASE` clause in SQL lets you write **conditional logic** in queries, similar to `if-else` or `switch-case` in programming languages.

---

### 🧩 Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2,
       CASE
           WHEN condition1 THEN result1
           WHEN condition2 THEN result2
           ELSE default_result
       END AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
```

✅ **Where can you use it?**

* `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `ORDER BY`, etc.
  ✅ **Why use `CASE` over `IF()`?**
* Handles **multiple conditions**
* More readable and powerful

### 📋 Example: View All Students

```sql
SELECT * FROM student;

### 🏆 Grade Evaluation with `CASE`

#### 🔹 Multi-line format:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email, percentage,
       CASE
           WHEN percentage >= 80 AND percentage <= 100 THEN 'A+'
           WHEN percentage >= 60 AND percentage < 80 THEN 'A'
           WHEN percentage >= 45 AND percentage < 60 THEN 'B'
           WHEN percentage >= 33 AND percentage < 45 THEN 'C'
           WHEN percentage < 33 THEN 'Fail'
           ELSE 'Invalid Percentage'
       END AS Grade
FROM student;
```

#### 🔹 Single-line compact format:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email, percentage,
       CASE
           WHEN percentage >= 80 AND percentage <= 100 THEN 'A+'
           WHEN percentage >= 60 AND percentage < 80 THEN 'A'
           WHEN percentage >= 45 AND percentage < 60 THEN 'B'
           WHEN percentage >= 33 AND percentage < 45 THEN 'C'
           WHEN percentage < 33 THEN 'Fail'
           ELSE 'Invalid Percentage'
       END AS Grade
FROM student;
```

### ✏️ Update Values with `CASE`

#### 🔹 Conditionally update `percentage`:

```sql
UPDATE student
SET percentage = (
    CASE id
        WHEN 4 THEN 80
        WHEN 7 THEN 45
        ELSE percentage
    END
)
WHERE id IN (4, 7);
```

#### 🔹 View updated table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM student;
```
