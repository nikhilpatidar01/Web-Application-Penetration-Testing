# Read Data SQL Select

## üìñ **SQL SELECT (Read Data)**

The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It‚Äôs the most used command in SQL for reading data.

---

### üîß **Basic Syntax**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
ORDER BY column ASC|DESC
LIMIT number;
```

---

### üì• **Read All Data (All Columns)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

üìå Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user2;
```

> Retrieves all columns and rows from the `user2` table.

---

### üéØ **Read Specific Columns**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```

üìå Examples:

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM user2;
SELECT id, name, age FROM user2;
```

> Fetches only the mentioned columns.

---

### üîç **Filtering Rows (WHERE Clause)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

üìå Examples:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE age > 20;
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE enable = 1;
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE enable != 1;
```

> Filters data based on the condition.

---

### üîó **Logical Operators (AND, OR, NOT)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition1 OR condition2;
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE NOT condition;
```

---

### üß† **Pattern Matching (LIKE, REGEXP)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column LIKE '%pattern%';
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column REGEXP 'regex';
```

> `%` is a wildcard for any number of characters.

---

### üßÆ **Range and Set Filtering**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column IN (value1, value2);
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```

---

### üî¢ **Sorting Results**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column ASC;
SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column DESC;
```

> Sorts records in ascending/descending order.

---

### üßº **Select Unique Values**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column FROM table_name;
```

> Returns only distinct (non-duplicate) values.

---

### üö´ **NULL Checks**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column IS NOT NULL;
```

---

### ‚è≥ **Limit Rows (Pagination)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5;
```

> `OFFSET` is how many rows to skip.

---

### üìä **Aggregate Functions**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(column) FROM table_name;
SELECT SUM(column) FROM table_name;
SELECT AVG(column) FROM table_name;
SELECT MAX(column) FROM table_name;
SELECT MIN(column) FROM table_name;
```

> For totals, averages, min/max, etc.

---

## üíª Practical Examples

### üìÅ Show All Data from Database

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
USE armour_db;
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM user2;
```

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª Select Specific Columns (Aliasing Columns)

```sql
SELECT id, name FROM user2;
SELECT enable, id, name, email FROM user2;
SELECT id AS ID, name AS "Student Name", email AS "Email Address" FROM user2;
```

---

## üéØ Filtering With Conditions (WHERE)

```sql
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE id = 1;          -- Exact match
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE id < 5;          -- Less than
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE id > 5;          -- Greater than
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE enable = 0;      -- Disabled users
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name = 'rahul';  -- Name match
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE email = 'rahul@armour.com';
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE age > 20;
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE age < 20;
```

---

## üß† Complex Filtering

### ‚úÖ Using AND

```sql
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE age < 20 AND enable = 1;
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE age < 20 AND enable = 1 AND course_name = 'IT Security';
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE id > 5 AND enable = 1 AND course_name = 'IT Security';
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE id > 5 AND enable = 0 AND course_name = 'IT Security';
```

---

### üü† Using OR

```sql
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE age < 20 OR enable = 1;
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE id > 5 OR enable = 1 OR course_name = 'IT Security';
```

---

### üîÑ Using AND + OR (Grouped)

```sql
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE (id > 5 OR enable = 1) AND course_name = 'IT Security';
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE (id > 1 OR name = 'admin') AND enable = 1;
```

---

### ‚ùå Using NOT

```sql
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE NOT enable = 1;
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE NOT id = 1;
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE NOT id > 5;
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE NOT age > 20;
```

---

## üîÑ SELECT with NOT Operator

Negates a condition. Returns rows where the condition is **not** true.

```sql
-- user2 who are not enabled
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE NOT enable = 1;

-- user2 with ID not equal to 1
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE NOT id = 1;

-- user2 where ID is NOT greater than 5
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE NOT id > 5;

-- user2 who are 20 or younger
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE NOT age > 20;
```

---

## üß© SELECT with IN and NOT IN Operators

Matches values **within** a list or **not** within a list.

```sql
-- user2 with ID 5 or 9
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE id IN (5, 9);

-- user2 with ID 4, 6, or 8
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE id IN (4, 6, 8);

-- user2 aged 18 or 20
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE age IN (18, 20);

-- user2 NOT aged 18 or 20
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE age NOT IN (18, 20);

-- user2 with ID NOT 2 or 8
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE id NOT IN (2, 8);
```

---

## üîÅ SELECT with BETWEEN and NOT BETWEEN Operators

```sql
-- user2 with ID between 5 and 8 (inclusive)
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE id BETWEEN 5 AND 8;

-- user2 with ID less than 5 or greater than 8
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE id NOT BETWEEN 5 AND 8;

-- Names alphabetically between 'a' and 'u'
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name BETWEEN 'a' AND 'u';

-- Age between 18 and 20
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 20;
```

---

## üîé SELECT with LIKE and NOT LIKE

Wildcards:

* `%` ‚Üí zero or more characters
* `_` ‚Üí exactly one character

```sql
-- Names starting with 'a'
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name LIKE 'a%';

-- Names ending with 'n'
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name LIKE '%n';

-- Names with 'd' as second character
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name LIKE '_d%';

-- Names exactly 5 characters ending with 'min'
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name LIKE '__min';

-- Name starts with 'u' AND course starts with 'l'
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name LIKE 'u%' AND course_name LIKE 'l%';

-- Name starts with 'u' OR course starts with 'l'
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name LIKE 'u%' OR course_name LIKE 'l%';

-- Name does NOT start with 'u'
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name NOT LIKE 'u%';
```

---

## üî§ SELECT with REGEXP (Regular Expressions)

```sql
-- Names starting with 'ad'
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name REGEXP '^ad';

-- Names ending with 'n'
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name REGEXP 'n$';

-- Names ending in a digit
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name REGEXP '[0-9]$';

-- Names containing 'admin' or 'user'
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name REGEXP 'admin|user';

-- 'a' followed by any one character
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name REGEXP 'a.';

-- 'a' followed by exactly 2 characters
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name REGEXP 'a..';

-- 'a' followed by exactly 5 characters
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name REGEXP 'a.....';

-- 'a' or 'u' followed by a digit
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name REGEXP '[au][0-9]';

-- Contains any lowercase letter
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name REGEXP '[a-z]';
```

---

## üóÇ ORDER BY (Sorting)

```sql
-- Alphabetical order by name
SELECT * FROM user2 ORDER BY name ASC;

-- Age descending
SELECT * FROM user2 ORDER BY age DESC;

-- Enabled user2 last
SELECT * FROM user2 ORDER BY enable DESC;

-- Enabled user2 first
SELECT * FROM user2 ORDER BY enable ASC;

-- Enabled user2 sorted by age (newest first)
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE enable = 1 ORDER BY age DESC;

-- Disabled user2 sorted by age descending
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE enable = 0 ORDER BY age DESC;
```

---

## üß† DISTINCT Keyword

```sql
-- Unique course names
SELECT DISTINCT course_name FROM user2;

-- Unique enable values
SELECT DISTINCT enable FROM user2;

-- Unique email addresses
SELECT DISTINCT email FROM user2;
```

---

## üï≥ NULL and IS NOT NULL

```sql
-- user2 where enable is NULL
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE enable IS NULL;

-- user2 where enable is NOT NULL
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE enable IS NOT NULL;

-- user2 with missing name
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name IS NULL;

-- user2 with name present
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name IS NOT NULL;
```

---

## üìÑ Pagination with LIMIT and OFFSET

```sql
-- First record
SELECT * FROM user2 LIMIT 1;

-- First 2 records
SELECT * FROM user2 LIMIT 2;

-- Skip first 3, return 1 (i.e. 4th row)
SELECT * FROM user2 LIMIT 3, 1;

-- Skip 3, return next 4 rows
SELECT * FROM user2 LIMIT 3, 4;

-- Filter where ID > 5, then skip 2 and return 4
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE id > 5 LIMIT 2, 4;

-- Enabled user2, skip 1, return next 4
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE enable = 1 LIMIT 1, 4;

-- Enabled user2, return first 4
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE enable = 1 LIMIT 0, 4;
```

---

## üìä Aggregate Functions

```sql
-- Total number of non-null IDs
SELECT COUNT(id) FROM user2;

-- Sum of IDs
SELECT SUM(id) FROM user2;

-- Max ID
SELECT MAX(id) FROM user2;

-- Min ID
SELECT MIN(id) FROM user2;

-- Average ID
SELECT AVG(id) FROM user2;

-- Max ID among enabled user2
SELECT MAX(id) FROM user2 WHERE enable = 1;

-- Max ID among disabled user2
SELECT MAX(id) FROM user2 WHERE enable = 0;

-- Invalid: SUM(name) ‚Üí Error (non-numeric)
-- Valid: Lexicographically max name
SELECT MAX(name) FROM user2;

-- Lexicographically min name
SELECT MIN(name) FROM user2;
```
