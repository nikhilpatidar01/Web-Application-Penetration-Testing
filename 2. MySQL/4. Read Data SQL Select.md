# Read Data SQL Select

## 📖 **SQL SELECT (Read Data)**

The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It’s the most used command in SQL for reading data.

---

### 🔧 **Basic Syntax**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
ORDER BY column ASC|DESC
LIMIT number;
```

---

### 📥 **Read All Data (All Columns)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

📌 Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user2;
```

> Retrieves all columns and rows from the `user2` table.

---

### 🎯 **Read Specific Columns**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```

📌 Examples:

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM user2;
SELECT id, name, age FROM user2;
```

> Fetches only the mentioned columns.

---

### 🔍 **Filtering Rows (WHERE Clause)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

📌 Examples:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE age > 20;
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE enable = 1;
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE enable != 1;
```

> Filters data based on the condition.

---

### 🔗 **Logical Operators (AND, OR, NOT)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition1 OR condition2;
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE NOT condition;
```

---

### 🧠 **Pattern Matching (LIKE, REGEXP)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column LIKE '%pattern%';
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column REGEXP 'regex';
```

> `%` is a wildcard for any number of characters.

---

### 🧮 **Range and Set Filtering**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column IN (value1, value2);
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```

---

### 🔢 **Sorting Results**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column ASC;
SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column DESC;
```

> Sorts records in ascending/descending order.

---

### 🧼 **Select Unique Values**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column FROM table_name;
```

> Returns only distinct (non-duplicate) values.

---

### 🚫 **NULL Checks**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column IS NOT NULL;
```

---

### ⏳ **Limit Rows (Pagination)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5;
```

> `OFFSET` is how many rows to skip.

---

### 📊 **Aggregate Functions**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(column) FROM table_name;
SELECT SUM(column) FROM table_name;
SELECT AVG(column) FROM table_name;
SELECT MAX(column) FROM table_name;
SELECT MIN(column) FROM table_name;
```

> For totals, averages, min/max, etc.

## 💻 Practical Examples

### 📁 Show All Data from Database

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
USE armour_db;
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM user2;
```

---

### 🧑‍💻 Select Specific Columns (Aliasing Columns)

```sql
SELECT id, name FROM user2;
SELECT enable, id, name, email FROM user2;
SELECT id AS ID, name AS "Student Name", email AS "Email Address" FROM user2;
```

---

## 🎯 Filtering With Conditions (WHERE)

```sql
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE id = 1;          -- Exact match
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE id < 5;          -- Less than
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE id > 5;          -- Greater than
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE enable = 0;      -- Disabled users
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE name = 'rahul';  -- Name match
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE email = 'rahul@armour.com';
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE age > 20;
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE age < 20;
```

---

## 🧠 Complex Filtering

### ✅ Using AND

```sql
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE age < 20 AND enable = 1;
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE age < 20 AND enable = 1 AND course_name = 'IT Security';
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE id > 5 AND enable = 1 AND course_name = 'IT Security';
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE id > 5 AND enable = 0 AND course_name = 'IT Security';
```

---

### 🟠 Using OR

```sql
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE age < 20 OR enable = 1;
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE id > 5 OR enable = 1 OR course_name = 'IT Security';
```

---

### 🔄 Using AND + OR (Grouped)

```sql
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE (id > 5 OR enable = 1) AND course_name = 'IT Security';
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE (id > 1 OR name = 'admin') AND enable = 1;
```

---

### ❌ Using NOT

```sql
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE NOT enable = 1;
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE NOT id = 1;
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE NOT id > 5;
SELECT * FROM user2 WHERE NOT age > 20;
```
