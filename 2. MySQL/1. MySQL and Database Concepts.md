## 🛠️ Database Management Systems (DBMS)

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is software used to create, manage, and interact with databases.

### Examples of DBMS:

* **MySQL** – Commonly used with PHP
* **MariaDB** – Similar to MySQL, used with PHP
* **PostgreSQL** – Used with Python, PHP
* **Microsoft SQL Server** – Used with .NET
* **Oracle RDBMS** – Common with Java
* **IBM DB2**
* **MongoDB** – A NoSQL database
* **SQLite** – Lightweight and file-based

## ❓ What is a Database?

* A **database** is an organized collection of data.
* It stores data in a format that is easy to access, read, and write.

### Benefits of Using a Database:

* Stores more data than spreadsheets
* Better data organization
* Faster data access
* Easier data manipulation
* Allows relationships between data

🔍 *Spreadsheets are optimized for calculations, whereas databases are optimized for structured data storage and relationships.*

## 🗂️ Types of Databases

### 1. Relational Database (RDBMS)

* Uses **SQL (Structured Query Language)**
* Data is stored in tables with relationships

### 2. NoSQL Database

* Not table-based
* Document-oriented or key-value-based
* Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB

## 🧱 Database Structure

* **Database**: A set of tables. One database typically supports one application. Access permissions are set at the database level.
* **Table**: A set of columns and rows, representing one entity (e.g., `users`, `orders`, `products`).
* **Column**: A specific data type (e.g., `first_name`, `email`).
* **Row**: A single record (e.g., `rahul`, `jain`, `rahul@armourinfosec.com`).
* **Field**: The intersection of a row and column (e.g., `first_name: rahul`).
* **Index**: Improves the speed of data lookup, similar to the index in a book.
* **Foreign Key**: A column that refers to a row in another table; it establishes a relationship between tables.
