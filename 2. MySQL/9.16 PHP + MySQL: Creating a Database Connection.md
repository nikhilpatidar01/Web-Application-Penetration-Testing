## 🧠 PHP + MySQL: Creating a Database Connection (MySQLi)

This guide shows you how to establish a secure connection between PHP and MySQL using the **MySQLi** extension.

---

### 📁 File: `connection_db.php`

```php
<?php
// 1. Create a database connection
$dbhost = "localhost";
$dbuser = "root";
$dbpass = "root";
$dbname = "nikhil_db";

// 2. Attempt to connect
$connection = mysqli_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass, $dbname);

// 3. Check connection
if (mysqli_connect_error()) {
    die("Database Connection Failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Connection with DB</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>✅ Database connection successful!</h1>
</body>
</html>
<?php
// 4. Close the database connection
mysqli_close($connection);
?>
```

---

### 🖥️ Output

When opened in the browser, this page should display:

```
✅ Database connection successful!
```

If there's an issue, the error message will be displayed instead.

### ✅ Best Practices

* Always check for errors using `mysqli_connect_error()`.
* Always close the connection using `mysqli_close()` to free up server resources.
* **Avoid hardcoding credentials** in production. Use:

  * `.env` files with libraries like `vlucas/phpdotenv`
  * Constants stored in a secure config file
  * Server environment variables

### 🧪 Test Your Setup

Make sure:

1. MySQL Server is running.
2. Database `nikhil_db` exists.
3. File is hosted in your local server directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
4. Visit the script in browser:

```
http://localhost/connection_db.php
```
