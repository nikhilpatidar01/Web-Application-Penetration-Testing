### üîç **What is a VIEW?**

A **VIEW** is a **virtual table** that shows data from one or more base tables using a stored SQL query. It **does not store data physically** ‚Äî it simply displays query results in real-time.

---

### ‚úÖ **Advantages of VIEWs**

* Simplifies complex joins and queries
* Helps in **data abstraction** by hiding sensitive columns/rows
* Adds a logical layer between users and base tables
* **No physical storage** required
* Useful for **restricting access** (e.g., readonly views)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disadvantages of VIEWs**

* Slower performance on large or nested views
* View breaks if base table schema changes
* Dropping a base table invalidates dependent views
* Computed **at runtime**, not pre-stored (can be slower)
* Complex or nested views may consume more **memory/CPU**

### üõ†Ô∏è **Creating a VIEW**

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT columns
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.col = table2.col;
```

#### Example:

```sql
CREATE VIEW user_info AS
SELECT 
    u.id,
    u.name,
    u.age,
    u.gender,
    u.email,
    c.course_name,
    ct.city_name
FROM users u
JOIN course c ON u.course_id = c.course_id
JOIN city ct ON u.city_id = ct.city_id;
```

Then run:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user_info;
```

---

### üîÅ **Modifying a VIEW**

```sql
ALTER VIEW view_name AS
SELECT columns ...
```

#### Example:

```sql
ALTER VIEW user_info AS
SELECT 
    u.id,
    u.name,
    u.email,
    c.course_name,
    ct.city_name
FROM users u
JOIN course c ON u.course_id = c.course_id
JOIN city ct ON u.city_id = ct.city_id;
```

Then run:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user_info;
```

---

### ‚ôªÔ∏è **Create or Replace a VIEW**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT columns ...
```

#### Example:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW user_info AS
SELECT 
    u.id,
    u.name,
    u.age,
    u.gender,
    u.email,
    c.course_name,
    ct.city_name
FROM users u
JOIN course c ON u.course_id = c.course_id
JOIN city ct ON u.city_id = ct.city_id;
```

Then run:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user_info;
```

---

### üîç **Querying a VIEW**

```sql
SELECT * FROM user_info;
```

---

### üìù **Renaming a VIEW**

```sql
RENAME TABLE old_view_name TO new_view_name;
```

#### Example:

```sql
RENAME TABLE user_info TO userinfo;
```

---

### ‚ùå **Dropping a VIEW**

```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

#### Example:

```sql
DROP VIEW userinfo;
```

---

### üìÇ **Related Commands**

```sql
SHOW TABLES;  
-- Lists all tables and views

SHOW FULL TABLES WHERE Table_type = 'VIEW';  
-- Lists only views

SHOW CREATE VIEW view_name;  
-- Shows SQL definition of a view
```
