## üìò MySQL - VIEWS

### üîç What is a VIEW?

A **VIEW** is a *virtual table* that displays data from one or more base tables.
It does **not store data physically**, but shows results of a stored SQL query.

---

### ‚úÖ Advantages of VIEWs

* Simplifies complex queries and access.
* Hides specific columns or rows (data abstraction & security).
* Adds a logical abstraction layer to the database.
* Does not consume physical disk space (data is not stored).
* Can restrict certain operations (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disadvantages of VIEWs

* Performance can degrade on large datasets or complex joins.
* VIEWs depend on underlying tables ‚Äî if those change, the VIEW may break.
* Dropping a base table invalidates dependent VIEWs.
* VIEWs are loaded at runtime (can be slower).
* Large or nested VIEWs may consume more memory.

### üõ† Creating a VIEW

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT columns
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.col = table2.col;
```

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE VIEW user_info AS
SELECT 
    u.id,
    u.name,
    u.age,
    u.gender,
    u.email,
    c.course_name,
    ct.city_name
FROM users u
JOIN course c ON u.course_id = c.course_id
JOIN city ct ON u.city_id = ct.city_id;

```

### Then RUN

```sql
SELECT * FROM user_info;
```

---

### üîÅ Modifying a VIEW

```sql
ALTER VIEW view_name AS
SELECT columns ...
```

**Example:**

```sql
ALTER VIEW user_info AS
SELECT u.id, u.name, u.email,
       course.course_name, city.city_name
FROM users u
JOIN course ON u.course_name = course.course_id
JOIN city ON u.city_name = city.city_id;
```
### Then RUN
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_info;
```
---

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Create or Replace a VIEW

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT columns ...
```

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW user_info AS
SELECT u.id, u.name, u.age, u.gender, u.email,
       course.course_name, city.city_name
FROM users u
JOIN course ON u.course_name = course.course_id
JOIN city ON u.city_name = city.city_id;
```
### Then RUN
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_info;
```
---

### üîç Querying a VIEW

```sql
SELECT * FROM user_info;
```

---

### üìù Renaming a VIEW

```sql
RENAME TABLE old_view_name TO new_view_name;
```

**Example:**

```sql
RENAME TABLE user_info TO userinfo;
```

---

### ‚ùå Dropping a VIEW

```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Example:**

```sql
DROP VIEW userinfo;
```

```sql
SHOW TABLES;                                      -- Lists all tables and views
SHOW FULL TABLES WHERE Table_type = 'VIEW';       -- Lists only views
SHOW CREATE VIEW view_name;                       -- Shows the SQL used to create a view
```
