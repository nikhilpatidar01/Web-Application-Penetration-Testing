# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** remains one of the most critical web security risks. It allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into trusted websites, causing visitors’ browsers to execute this untrusted code. This can lead to anything from **credential theft** to full system compromise.

### How XSS Works

- **Untrusted Data Input:** XSS occurs when user-supplied data is embedded in web pages without adequate validation or sanitization.
- **Script Execution:** Attackers typically inject **JavaScript** (but can use any browser-supported language), which executes whenever another user visits the maliciously crafted page or link, running in the context of the target site.

### Types of XSS Attacks

- **Reflected XSS:** The payload is reflected off a web server, usually via URL parameters, and executed immediately in the victim’s browser.
- **Stored (Persistent) XSS:** The payload is stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and then delivered to and executed by each user who views the affected content.
- **DOM-based XSS:** The vulnerability is in client-side JavaScript code; the malicious changes happen when the DOM is insecurely manipulated, possibly without ever reaching the server.

### Risks and Impact

- **Theft of authentication cookies, session tokens, or sensitive user data.**
- **User impersonation, keylogging, phishing, or malware installation.**
- **Content modification:** including website defacement or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Prevalence:** XSS’s occurrence has increased alongside more dynamic, JavaScript-driven web applications.
- **Severe impact:** If an admin account is compromised, XSS can enable attackers to take over the entire application or system.

### XSS Prevention Best Practices

- **Sanitize and Encode Inputs:** Always handle user input as untrusted. Encode all output according to context (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, URL, etc.).
- **Use Secure Frameworks or Libraries:** Utilize frameworks that automatically apply appropriate output encoding and help mitigate XSS risks.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement strict CSP headers to prevent inline and unauthorized scripts. Example:

  ```
  Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-src 'none'; base-uri 'none';
  ```

- **Regular Testing and Code Review:** Use security scanning tools (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP) and conduct frequent code reviews to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Many XSS incidents in 2025 still result from outdated third-party libraries or components. Regularly apply patches and updates.

**Proper prevention and vigilance are essential. If you need practical code examples or want to understand specific techniques (like CSP implementation or secure templating), just let me know!**
