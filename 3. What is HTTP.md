# Web Fundamentals

## What is HTTP/HTTPS?

* **HTTP** stands for *HyperText Transfer Protocol*.
* **HTTPS** is the secure version of HTTP — it adds encryption via SSL/TLS.
* HTTP/HTTPS are protocols used to transfer HTML and other resources between:

  * **Servers** (where websites are hosted)
  * **Clients** (browsers, phones, etc.)
* HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions servers and clients should take.

### Example of an HTTP request:

```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

### HTTP Versions

| Version  | Year | Key Features                                                              |
| -------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HTTP/0.9 | 1991 | Very simple; only GET method; raw HTML only                               |
| HTTP/1.0 | 1996 | Added status codes and headers (like `Content-Type`)                      |
| HTTP/1.1 | 1997 | Persistent connections (keep-alive), caching improvements                 |
| HTTP/2   | 2015 | Multiplexing (multiple requests in one connection), binary format, faster |
| HTTP/3   | 2022 | Based on QUIC (UDP), faster, better for mobile and streaming              |

## What is HTML?

* **HTML** stands for *HyperText Markup Language*.
* It is **not** a protocol.
* HTML is a **markup language** used to:

  * Structure content on the web (headings, paragraphs, links, tables, images, etc.)
  * Organize information so browsers can display it visually.
* HTML files typically use the `.html` extension.

### Example of simple HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### HTML Versions

| Version   | Year | Key Features                                                 |
| --------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| HTML 2.0  | 1995 | First official standard                                      |
| HTML 3.2  | 1997 | Tables, applets, scripting support                           |
| HTML 4.01 | 1999 | Better forms, style sheets (CSS) support                     |
| XHTML 1.0 | 2000 | Stricter XML-based version of HTML                           |
| HTML5     | 2014 | Video/audio tags, canvas, responsive design, modern web apps |

## How They Work Together

| HTML                   | HTTP/HTTPS                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Markup Language        | Communication Protocol                            |
| Structures content     | Transfers content                                 |
| Saved in `.html` files | Defines how data moves between browser and server |

**How it works:**

1. You type a URL (e.g., `https://example.com`)
2. The browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server.
3. The server responds with an HTML file.
4. The browser renders the HTML into a visible web page.

> **HTML builds the content.**
> **HTTP/HTTPS moves the content.**

Modern websites typically use **HTML5** and **HTTP/2 or HTTP/3** for best performance.

# HTTP Requests and Responses

## 1. What is an HTTP Request?

* A message sent by a client (browser, app) to a server, requesting resources such as web pages, files, or data.

### HTTP Methods

| Method  | Purpose                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------ |
| GET     | Retrieve data                  |
| POST    | Submit data to the server      |
| PUT     | Update existing data           |
| DELETE  | Remove data                    |
| PATCH   | Partially update data          |
| OPTIONS | Describe communication options |

### Example: Simple `GET` Request Using Fetch API (JavaScript)

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

## HTTP Request Structure

An HTTP request typically consists of:

### 1. Request Line

```http
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
```

### 2. Headers

Provide meta-information about the request.

**Common Headers:**

* `Host`
* `User-Agent`
* `Accept`
* `Authorization`

### 3. Body *(optional)*

Used mainly with `POST`, `PUT`, or `PATCH` requests. Contains data (like JSON or form fields).

**Example of a POST request body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "username": "example",
  "password": "secure123"
}
```

---

## Example Request Headers

```http
GET /phpinfo.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.31
Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.9
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/135.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: keep-alive
```

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /phpinfo.php HTTP/1.1`          | Request line: Ask the server to return `/phpinfo.php` using HTTP/1.1.           |
| `Host: 192.168.1.31`                 | Tells the server which host/IP the request is for (useful for virtual hosting). |
| `Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.9`    | Prefers English (UK) but will accept general English as well.                   |
| `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1`       | Requests the server to upgrade to HTTPS if possible.                            |
| `User-Agent: Mozilla/...`            | Identifies the browser and OS (Chrome 135 on Linux x86\_64).                    |
| `Accept: ...`                        | Lists content types the browser can handle (HTML, XML, images, etc.).           |
| `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br` | Supports compressed responses to save bandwidth.                                |
| `Connection: keep-alive`             | Suggests keeping the TCP connection open for faster subsequent requests.        |

> Your browser (Chrome 135 on Linux) is sending a `GET` request to a server at `192.168.1.31` asking for `phpinfo.php`.
> It states:
>
> * "I prefer English content"
> * "I accept compressed files (gzip, br)"
> * "Please keep the connection open"
> * "I support HTTPS upgrades"

# 2. What is an HTTP Responses?

## What is an HTTP Response?

* A message sent by a server back to the client, in reply to an HTTP request. It includes status information, headers, and optionally a body (data like HTML, JSON, etc.).

| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 200  | OK                    | Request was successful                     |
| 301  | Moved Permanently     | Resource has been moved to a new URL       |
| 302  | Found                 | Temporary redirection                      |
| 400  | Bad Request           | Client sent an invalid request             |
| 401  | Unauthorized          | Authentication required                    |

  .then(response => {
    console.log('Status:', response.status);
    console.log('Headers:', response.headers.get('Content-Type'));
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

## HTTP Response Structure

An HTTP response typically contains:

### 1. Status Line

```http
