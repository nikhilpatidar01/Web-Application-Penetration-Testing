# Scope and Global Variables

**PHP Scope and Global Variables**

PHP variables have different scopes that determine where they can be accessed within a script. Understanding local, global, and static scopes is essential for managing variables effectively and avoiding conflicts or unexpected behaviors.

## Types of Scope in PHP

### 1. Global Scope

* Variables declared **outside** of any function are in the global scope.
* These variables are not accessible **directly** inside functions.
* To access them inside a function, you must use the `global` keyword.

### 2. Local Scope

* Variables declared **inside** a function have local scope.
* They are not accessible outside the function in which they are declared.

### 3. Static Scope

* A `static` variable does **not lose its value** when the function exits.
* It retains its value between multiple function calls.

## PHP Code Example

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>PHP Scope and Global Variables</title>
</head>
<body>

  <h2>PHP Scope and Global Variables Example</h2>

  <?php
  $x = "Outside"; // Global variable

  function testScope() {
      global $x;
      echo $x . "<br>";  // Access global variable inside function
      $x = "Inside";     // Change the global variable's value
      echo $x . "<br>";  // Display changed value
  }

  echo $x . "<br>"; // Output: Outside
  testScope();      // Output: Outside Inside
  echo $x . "<br>"; // Output: Inside
  ?>

</body>
</html>

```
