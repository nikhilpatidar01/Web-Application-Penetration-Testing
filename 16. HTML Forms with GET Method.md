# 📘 HTML Forms with GET Method in PHP
This example demonstrates how to create a basic HTML form using the `GET` method in PHP and how to retrieve submitted form data in the `process-get.php` file.

---

## 📝 Notes on the GET Method

🔓 **URL Exposure** – All form data is appended to the URL as query parameters (e.g., `?key=value&name=abc`).
👁️ **Visible in Browser** – Data is visible in the browser’s address bar, browser history, and server logs.
🔸 **Best for Non-sensitive Data** – Use only for non-sensitive actions like search, filters, or navigation.
❌ **Not for Passwords or Personal Data** – Avoid sending passwords, credit card info, or private content using GET.
📏 **Size Limit** – Total URL length is limited to around 2,048 characters (browser-dependent).
🔁 **Easily Bookmarked and Shared** – GET URLs can be copied, bookmarked, and reused for repeatable actions.

### 🆚 GET vs POST in PHP – One-Line Comparison

🔓 **GET** – Appends data to the URL, visible in address bar 🌐
🔐 **POST** – Sends data invisibly in the request body 📩

🧾 **GET** – Data is limited (\~2048 characters max) 📏
📦 **POST** – No size limit for submitted data 🧳

📌 **GET** – Useful for bookmarks, search, filters 🔍
🔒 **POST** – Best for sensitive data like passwords 🔑

🧠 **GET** – Less secure, do not use for login or private info 🚫
🛡️ **POST** – More secure for sensitive transactions ✅

🧰 **GET** – Can be cached and saved in browser history 🧠
🧼 **POST** – Cannot be cached or bookmarked easily 🗂️

### Exmample:
### forms-get.php

This file contains a **simple login form** using the **GET** method to submit data. It is best used for **non-sensitive tasks** like searching or filtering, not for passwords or personal information.


```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>GET Method Form</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Login Form (GET Method)</h2>

<form action="process-get.php" method="GET">
  Username: <input type="text" name="username" value="" /><br />
  Password: <input type="password" name="passwd" value="" /><br />
  <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Login" />
</form>

<!--
 Notes on the GET Method:
- URL Exposure: All form data is visible in the browser address bar (?key=value).
- Visible: Data can be logged in server logs, browser history, etc.
- Not secure: Do not use GET for passwords or personal data.
- Limit: URL length is typically limited to 2048 characters.
- Reusable: URLs can be bookmarked or shared, good for searches and filters.
-->

</body>
</html>

### 📄 `process-get.php`

This file **receives and displays data** submitted via the **GET** method in PHP.

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Process Form</title>
</head>
<body>

<pre>
<?php
print_r($_GET);
?>
</pre>

<?php
$username = $_GET['username'];
$password = $_GET['passwd'];

echo "Username : {$username} <br />";
echo "Password : {$password} <br />";
?>
</body>
</html>
```
---
### ⚠️ Security Warning
Never use the **GET** method for sensitive data like passwords. GET parameters are:
• Logged in browser history and server logs 📜
• Visible in URLs and may be cached or shared 🌐
• Limited in size (approximately 2048 characters) 📏
---


### Tip for Testing Long Query Strings
Use tools like **pwgen** to generate a long test password and check the character limit (\~2048 characters).
If the password exceeds the GET URL limit, it will likely be truncated.


### Best Practices
• Use **GET** for search forms and non-sensitive queries.
• Use **POST** for login forms and confidential information.
• Always validate and sanitize user input on the server side.
