# 🔐 Sandbox in Web Application Security

A **sandbox** is a secure, isolated environment used to **run untrusted or potentially dangerous code, files, or programs** without risking the host system. It acts as a protective layer that limits the access of malicious software or scripts.

---

## 🧠 Why Use a Sandbox?

* 🛡️ Prevent system compromise
* 🧪 Safely test untrusted or suspicious code
* 🐞 Analyze malware behavior in a controlled setup
* 🔬 Contain exploits during vulnerability research
* 🌐 Secure application components like **browser tabs, plugins, or file uploads**

---

## 🧱 Types of Sandboxes

### 1. 🌍 **Browser Sandboxing**

* Isolates each browser tab or plugin from full system access
* Prevents malicious websites from accessing OS-level resources
* Common in browsers like **Chrome** (Site Isolation)

---

### 2. 💻 **Operating System Sandboxes**

* Offers system-wide protection by running apps in isolated environments
* **Examples:**

  * 🔒 `Firejail` (Linux)
  * 🪟 `Windows Sandbox`
  * 🧩 `AppArmor`, `SELinux`
  * 📦 `Docker` (containerization = lightweight sandboxing)

---

### 3. 📱 **Application-Level Sandboxing**

* Web or mobile applications may sandbox:

  * User sessions
  * Uploaded files
  * Scripts (e.g., client-side JavaScript or eval())
* Prevents **user-level abuse** and **unauthorized code execution**

---

### 4. 🧪 **Online Sandbox Tools**

Used by analysts and researchers for **malware detonation**, **file inspection**, and **threat hunting**.

Popular tools:

* ⚔️ [Any.Run](https://any.run)
* 🧠 [Joe Sandbox](https://www.joesecurity.org/)
* 🔬 [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/)

These services execute suspicious files in the cloud and provide detailed behavioral reports.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Sandboxing in Penetration Testing

* **Red teamers and pentesters** often attempt to **bypass or escape sandboxed environments** to demonstrate high-impact exploits.
* Common targets:

  * **Browser sandbox escape**
  * **Docker container breakout**
  * **Privilege escalation via sandbox misconfigurations**

Exploiting sandbox escapes can lead to **complete system compromise**, making this a **critical issue** in real-world testing.
