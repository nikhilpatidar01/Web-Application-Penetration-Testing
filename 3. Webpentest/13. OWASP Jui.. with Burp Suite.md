# 🛡️ OWASP Juice Shop + Burp Suite – Practical Workflow (Short Notes)

### 🛒 What is [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/)?

* A **deliberately vulnerable e-commerce website**.
* Used to practice **real-world web application attacks** (XSS, SQLi, IDOR, etc.).
* Includes features like **Login, Register, Search, Cart, Checkout**, etc.

---

### 📧 Email Alias

* Always use a **fake/alias email** (e.g., `test@alias.com`) while registering.
* Avoid using your real email.

You can create aliases like:
* originalemail+test1@gmail.com
* originalemail+juiceshop123@gmail.com

---

### ❓ Security Question = Wrong Answer

* While signing up, **intentionally enter a wrong answer** for the security question.
* One challenge is to **guess the correct answer later**.

---

### 🔐 Create Account & Login

* Register on Juice Shop using the alias email.
* After logging in, open the site in **[Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)** to start testing.

---

### 🕸️ Crawl with Burp Suite

* Use **Crawl Only** or **Crawl and Audit** in Burp Suite.
* Burp will discover all **pages, endpoints, and parameters**.
* Everything will appear under **Target → Site Map**.

---

### 💻 Use Terminal Tools

For recon and brute-forcing, use tools like:

* [`ffuf`](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf)
* [`dirsearch`](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch)
* [`gobuster`](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster)
* [`curl`](https://curl.se/)

These help find hidden paths, files, and parameters.

---

### 💳 Use Sandbox Credit Card

* Use fake card details for placing orders:

  ```
  Card Number: 4111 1111 1111 1111  
  Expiry: Any future date  
  CVV: Any 3 digits
  ```
* It's a test environment — no real payment involved.

---

### 📜 Read the Policy Page

* After login, **visit the Security Policy page** on Juice Shop.
* Some challenges are based on that page's content.
