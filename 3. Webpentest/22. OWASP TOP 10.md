## 📊 OWASP Top 10 — 2021 Edition

Updated to reflect **modern threats**, **software supply chain risks**, and **insecure design practices**.

---

### 🔐 A01:2021 — Broken Access Control

**Description:**
> Improper enforcement of access control policies can allow attackers to access unauthorized functions or data.

**Examples:**
* URL tampering
* Forceful browsing
* Privilege escalation
  **Note:** Most commonly exploited risk, present in \~94% of tested applications.

---

### 🔒 A02:2021 — Cryptographic Failures

*(Previously: Sensitive Data Exposure)*

**Description:**
> Weak or misconfigured cryptographic protections expose sensitive data like credentials and PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

**Examples:**
* Using HTTP instead of HTTPS
* Insecure key storage
* Weak hashing (e.g., MD5)

---

### 💉 A03:2021 — Injection

**Description:**
>  Malicious data sent to interpreters (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, LDAP) leading to unintended execution.

**Examples:**

* SQL Injection
* Command Injection
* Server-Side Template Injection

---

### 🧱 A04:2021 — Insecure Design

**New Category**

**Description:**
>  Design flaws due to missing threat models, insecure workflows, or poor architecture.

**Examples:**
* No threat modeling
* Insecure default logic
* Lack of secure development lifecycle

---

### ⚙️ A05:2021 — Security Misconfiguration

**Description:**
>  Using default settings or exposing sensitive data through verbose errors or open services.

**Examples:**
* Exposed admin interfaces
* Misconfigured HTTP headers
* Open S3 buckets or cloud storage

---

### 🧩 A06:2021 — Vulnerable and Outdated Components

*(Previously: Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities)*

**Description:**
>  Third-party libraries and frameworks with unpatched vulnerabilities.

**Examples:**
* Log4Shell vulnerability
* Apache Struts exploits
* Outdated JavaScript libraries (e.g., jQuery)

---

### 👤 A07:2021 — Identification and Authentication Failures

*(Previously: Broken Authentication)*

**Description:**
> Flaws in login and identity verification systems.

**Examples:**
* Predictable login tokens
* Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
* Weak password reset logic

---

### 🧪 A08:2021 — Software and Data Integrity Failures

**New Category**

**Description:**
> Trust failures in CI/CD pipelines, unsigned updates, or deserialization flaws.

**Examples:**
* Tampered software packages
* Unverified plugins or modules
* Insecure deployment scripts

---

### 📉 A09:2021 — Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

*(Previously A10:2017)*

**Description:**
> Failure to detect, alert, or log suspicious activity.

**Examples:**
* No login audit trails
* No alerting system
* Logging sensitive data insecurely

---

### 🌐 A10:2021 — Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**New Entry**

**Description:**
> SSRF vulnerabilities allow attackers to make requests from the server to internal or external systems.

**Examples:**
* Accessing internal AWS EC2 metadata
* Port scanning internal networks
* Interacting with internal-only APIs

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

OWASP isn’t just a list — it’s a **security mindset**.
By following OWASP principles, you:

* Reduce risk early in the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
* Make your apps resilient to evolving threats
* Join a **global security movement**
