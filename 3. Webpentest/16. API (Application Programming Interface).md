### ğŸ“¦ **Data Formats**:

* `XML` â†’ Older format
* `Plain Text` â†’ Sometimes visible in Burp Suite responses

### ğŸ›  **In Burp Suite**:

* **Request tab**: Shows how the API is called (headers, parameters)
* **Response tab**: Shows API data in **JSON** or **Plain Text**

> Burp Suite lets you **analyze the full API communication**

### ğŸ§ª **OWASP Juice Shop**:

* A **vulnerable web app lab** for practice
* It also contains **hidden REST APIs**
* When tested, it shows **JSON responses**

> Perfect for learning API hacking and testing ğŸ”“
