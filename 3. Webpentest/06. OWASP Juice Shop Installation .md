## 3️⃣ Install Node.js (v22.x)

Juice Shop requires Node.js 18+ (tested with v22.x works well): [Githube Link](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop)

[# Add Node.js v22.x repo and install](https://deb.nodesource.com/)
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | bash - 
apt-get install -y nodejs
```

### ✅ Verify Node.js Installation

```bash
node --help
node -v
node --version
```

### ✅ Verify npm Installation

```bash
npm --help
npm -v
npm --version
```


---

## 4️⃣ Download Juice Shop

* Get the latest compatible version from [Juice Shop Releases](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/releases).
* Example for v18.0.0 (Node 18+):

```bash
wget https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/releases/download/v18.0.0/juice-shop-18.0.0_node22_linux_x64.tgz

# Optional: Verify integrity (if checksum is provided)
md5sum juice-shop-18.0.0_node18_linux_x64.tgz
```

---

## 5️⃣ Extract and Move Files

```bash
# Extract
tar -xvf juice-shop-18.0.0_node22_linux_x64.tgz

# Move to /opt (or your preferred directory)
 mv -v juice-shop_18.0.0 /opt/
```

---

## 6️⃣ Start Juice Shop

```bash
cd /opt/juice-shop_18.0.0
npm start
```

### 🧪 Access in Browser:

```
http://192.168.1.23:3000
```
---


### **Debian Firewall Check — UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)**

#### ✅ **Step 1: Allow Port 3000 (TCP)**

```bash
sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp
sudo ufw reload
```

This opens the gate 🚪 for incoming connections on port 3000.

---

#### 🔎 **Step 2: Check UFW Status**

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

---

## 7️⃣ Create Auto-Start Script

## ⚙️ (Optional) Create a Systemd Service for Juice Shop

If you're also installing **OWASP Juice Shop**, you can set it up to run as a systemd service for easier control:

### ➕ Create a service file

```bash
vim /etc/systemd/system/juice-shop.service
```

**Paste the following:**

```ini
[Unit]
Description=OWASP Juice Shop
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/npm start
WorkingDirectory=/opt/juice-shop_18.0.0
Restart=always
User=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> 🔁 Make sure the Juice Shop is extracted to `/opt/juice-shop`

---

### 🔄 Reload, Enable, and Start the Service

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable juice-shop
systemctl start juice-shop
```

---

### ✅ Check Service Status

```bash
systemctl status juice-shop
```
