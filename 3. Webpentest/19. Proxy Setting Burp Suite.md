# 🔐 Burp Suite: Proxy Tab - Full Breakdown

The **Proxy tab** is the beating heart of **Burp Suite** for live HTTP(S) interception and manipulation. It’s where requests are **caught, dissected, modified**, and **forwarded** — all in real time.

---

## 🧩 1. **Intercept Sub-Tab**

### 🔄 Intercept: On / Off

* **Intercept On:**
  Catches all requests before they hit the server.
* **Intercept Off:**
  Lets requests pass through Burp without pausing.

> 📌 Pro Tip: Keep this **OFF when browsing normally**, and **ON when testing forms or login functions.**

---

### ▶️ Forward / ⛔ Drop

* **Forward:** Send the request exactly as is.
* **Drop:** Silently discard the request (useful to test server reaction or block specific requests).

---

### 🛠️ Action Menu

Click on **"Action"** and you’ll see a goldmine of options:

| Action                        | Use Case                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Send to Repeater**          | Manual testing, fuzzing, or replaying requests   |
| **Send to Intruder**          | Bruteforcing usernames, passwords, or parameters |
| **Send to Comparer**          | Analyze differences between responses            |
| **Send to Decoder**           | Encode/decode Base64, URL, hex                   |
| **Send to Logger++**          | Track request behavior in detail                 |
| **Change request method**     | Change POST → GET or vice versa                  |
| **Copy URL/Request/Response** | For report writing or collaboration              |

> 📎 **Match & Replace Rules:** Set automatic replacement rules (great for XSS payload injections or auth header manipulations).

---

### 🌐 Open Browser

Launches a **pre-configured Chromium browser** that:

* Automatically uses Burp’s proxy (no manual setup)
* Doesn’t store cache, cookies, or login info
* Perfect for **clean test sessions**

---

## 📜 2. **HTTP History Sub-Tab**

* Shows a **full list of all requests & responses**, whether intercepted or not.
* Includes **status codes, request size, response length, MIME type**, etc.

### Filters You Can Use:

✅ Show only requests with `200 OK`
🔎 Show only requests to a particular domain
🧼 Remove noise like images or CSS files

> 💡 This tab is great for **finding hidden endpoints**, **troubleshooting redirections**, or checking **JavaScript API calls**.

---

## 💬 3. **WebSockets Tab (WS)**

> Available in Pro version.

* Captures WebSocket communications
* Real-time **bi-directional** (client ⇄ server) message monitoring

You can **intercept, modify, drop** messages similar to HTTP.

---

## ⚙️ 4. **Options Sub-Tab (Proxy Settings)**

This tab is where the **magic happens under the hood**:

---

### 🔍 Intercept Client Requests

Set **custom rules** to intercept only requests matching your conditions.

#### 🧪 Example:

Only intercept:

```
URL contains /admin
OR
Method is POST
```

### 🧠 Request Intercept Rules

Use **regex** to match request patterns:

* `^` = start of string
* `$` = end of string

```bash
URL starts with ^/login
Method is ^POST$
```

---

### 📩 Response Intercept Rules

Same as request — but for **server responses**:

* Intercept 302 Redirects only
* Intercept responses with “Set-Cookie” headers

---

### 🧬 Response Modification Rules

Automatically **inject content or modify responses** — example:

* Add hidden fields
* Modify `<title>` for phishing demos
* Remove X-Frame-Options to allow iframe loading

---

### 👻 Hidden Fields

Automatically **unhide hidden HTML fields** like:

```html
<input type="hidden" name="admin" value="false">
```

You can **modify them on-the-fly**, testing privilege escalation, logic flaws, etc.

---

### 🔒 TLS/SSL Settings

Control how Burp deals with HTTPS:

* Accept invalid certificates
* Add your own trusted certs
* Set protocols (TLS 1.0 → 1.3)

> 💡 **Burp Certificate** must be installed in your browser for HTTPS interception.

---

### 🧠 Match and Replace (Power Tool!)

Automatically find-and-replace any string in request/response:

* Replace all `X-Frame-Options` with nothing (for Clickjacking testing)
* Replace `username=guest` → `username=admin`

---

## 🧠 Extra Mind-Worthy Knowledge & Tips

💥 **Memory Boosters:**

* **TLS pass through**: Some domains (like banking) use cert pinning. Add to `TLS Pass Through` list to avoid broken connections.
* **"Match and Replace" ≠ Manual Intercept** – it's **always-on auto-mutation**
* Burp **Proxy History** = goldmine for endpoint discovery (`robots.txt`, `.env`, `debug` endpoints)
* Save sessions as `.burp` file regularly – helps in reporting & rollback
* Use **Logger++** extension for real-time visibility of request history
* `Find hidden params` using Burp’s **Param Miner**
