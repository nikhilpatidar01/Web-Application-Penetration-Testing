# 🚀 CI/CD Pipelines 

## 📌 What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** stands for:

* **CI – Continuous Integration**
  → Automatically build and test code whenever developers push changes to the repo.

* **CD – Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment**
  →

  * **Continuous Delivery**: Automatically prepares code for deployment (but needs manual approval to deploy).
  * **Continuous Deployment**: Automatically deploys every code change to production once it passes tests — no manual steps.

> CI/CD pipelines help automate the full software lifecycle — from coding → testing → packaging → deployment.

## 🔁 CI/CD Lifecycle Stages

| Stage      | Description                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🏗️ Build  | Compile source code into binaries/artifacts. (e.g., `.jar`, `.exe`) |
| 🧪 Test    | Run automated unit, integration, and system tests.                  |
| 📦 Package | Bundle the application (e.g., Docker image, zip file).              |
| 📤 Release | Push artifacts to registries or repos (e.g., DockerHub, Nexus).     |
| 🚀 Deploy  | Deploy code to staging or production environments.                  |
| 📈 Monitor | Track logs, metrics, and system health after deployment.            |

## 🧪 Example: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline for Node.js

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

### 💡 Explanation:

* **`on: push`** → Trigger this pipeline when code is pushed to the `main` branch.
* **`checkout@v2`** → Checks out the code from the repo.
* **`setup-node@v3`** → Sets up Node.js environment.
* **`npm install`** → Installs packages.
* **`npm test`** → Runs the tests.

## 🔐 Bonus: Best Practices

* ✅ Use **secrets** to store API keys or credentials.
* ✅ Keep pipelines **fast** by caching dependencies.
* ✅ Include **security scanning** in the pipeline.
* ✅ Set up **automatic rollbacks** for failed deployments.
* ✅ Monitor with tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Datadog**, etc.
