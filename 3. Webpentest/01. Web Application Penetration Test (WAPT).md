# 🛡️ Web Application Penetration Test (WAPT)

Web application penetration testing is a **continuous and evolving** process that aligns with new-age security practices, threat landscapes, and development lifecycles.

## 🚨 Why Web Application Security Matters

1. **Attacks Target the Application Layer**
   Web apps are the frontline for hackers—especially with cloud apps, mobile access, and third-party integrations.

2. **Huge Attack Surface**
   Cloud services, APIs, and modern app architectures increase exposure and complexity.

3. **Complex Code = More Flaws**
   More code means more human errors—and more possible vulnerabilities.

4. **Rise of Automated Attacks**
   Tools like bots and scripts automate vulnerability discovery and exploitation.

5. **Security Skills Gap**
   Developers often lack up-to-date training on emerging threats.

6. **Speed > Security**
   Tight deadlines push security to the backburner—leaving holes wide open.

## 🔄 SDLC – Software Development Life Cycle

The SDLC is a framework guiding the development of software from **planning** to **deployment** and **maintenance**.

### 🧱 SDLC Phases

1. **Requirements**: Define functionality and security needs.
2. **Design**: Architect the app securely (access control, data flow).
3. **Coding**: Write code following secure coding standards.
4. **Testing**: Manual/automated security & bug testing.
5. **Deployment**: Harden configurations for production.

## 🔐 SSDLC – Secure Software Development Life Cycle

SSDLC builds **security into every SDLC phase**, addressing flaws before they hit production.

### 1. 📝 Requirements

* Define **security requirements** & **compliance goals** (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS).
* Conduct **threat modeling** early.

### 2. 🏗️ Design

* Perform **architecture reviews**.
* Plan **security testing** and model threats iteratively.

### 3. 💻 Coding

* Follow **OWASP** guidelines.
* Implement secure coding: input validation, encryption, authentication, etc.

### 4. 🧪 Testing

* Conduct **vulnerability assessments** regularly.
* Use **fuzz testing** and **static/dynamic analysis**.

### 5. 🚀 Deployment

* Review **server & network configs**.
* Implement **patch management**.

## ✅ Benefits of SSDLC

1. 🔐 **Security by Design** – Security becomes a foundational element.
2. 💸 **Cost Savings** – Fixing early is cheaper than post-breach.
3. 👨‍💻 **Dev Culture Shift** – Promotes long-term secure coding mindset.
4. 🛡️ **Better Risk Mitigation** – Proactively eliminates flaws.

## ⚠️ Common Web App Security Challenges

1. 💤 **Security as an Afterthought**
2. 🌀 **Overcomplicated Security Measures**
3. 💰 **High Cost of Advanced Testing**

## 🔍 Types of Application Security Testing

### 1. ⚪ White Box Testing

* Full source code access.
* Advanced real-time vulnerability scanning + code optimization.
* Expensive but deep.

### 2. ⚫ Black Box Testing

* No internal code access—real-world attacker simulation.
* Ideal for external vulnerability discovery.

### 3. ⚪⚫ Grey Box Testing

* Combines White + Black box advantages.
* Balanced view of internal and external attack surfaces.

## 🧨 Key Threat Vectors

1. **🛰️ Data Manipulation**

   * Via MITM, tampering, or insecure transmission.

2. **💣 Request Injection & Session Hijacking**

   * Inject malicious inputs or hijack active sessions.

3. **🔓 Insecure Access Methods**

   * APIs, mobile endpoints, or hidden routes often overlooked.

---

## 🛡️ Updated Defensive Measures

1. 🔑 **User Access Control**

   * MFA + RBAC = Strong identity boundaries.

2. 🧼 **Input Validation**

   * Sanitize inputs on **client + server side** to prevent SQLi/XSS.

3. 🤖 **Bot Detection**

   * CAPTCHA, fingerprinting, and behavior analysis.

4. 📊 **Monitoring & Logging**

   * Set up **real-time alerts**, log analysis, and incident response automation.
