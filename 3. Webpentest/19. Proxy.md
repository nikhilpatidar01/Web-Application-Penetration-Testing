# 🌐 Burp Suite: Proxy Tab Overview

The **Proxy** tab in Burp Suite is your gateway to **intercepting, modifying, and analyzing HTTP/S traffic** in real-time. It's one of the **most used features** during manual web application penetration testing.

---

## 🛡️ Key Use Case

Burp acts as a **man-in-the-middle (MITM)** proxy between your browser and the web server, allowing you to:

* Monitor requests and responses
* Modify data before it reaches the server/client
* Analyze real-time application behavior

## 🧭 Sections of the Proxy Tab

### 🔥 **1. Intercept (Default Tab)**

This is where live HTTP requests and responses **pause** before reaching their destination.

#### ✅ Key Features:

* **Intercept On / Off**
