# 🔐 Burp Suite - Intruder Tool

## 🚀 Overview

**Intruder** is a powerful automation tool in **Burp Suite** used for customized payload-based attacks on HTTP requests. It allows testing of inputs by injecting payloads into specific parts of the request.

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

Intruder can be used for:

* 🔓 Brute-forcing logins
* 👤 Enumerating users/accounts
* 💉 SQL Injection, XSS, and other injection flaws
* 🔍 Discovering hidden parameters or directories

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Capture Request:** Use Burp Proxy to intercept the request.
2. **Send to Intruder:** Right-click → `Send to Intruder`.
3. **Set Attack Positions:**

   * Highlight target parameters (e.g., `username`, `password`)
   * Burp adds `§` symbols around them → e.g., `username=§admin§`
4. **Choose Attack Type** (explained below).
5. **Load Payloads:** Add wordlists or custom inputs.
6. **Start Attack:** Analyze responses (length, status, etc.) to find valid results.

## 🎛️ Attack Types

| Attack Type       | Description                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sniper**        | Sends one payload to one position at a time. Best for single-field testing (e.g., XSS/SQLi).             |
| **Battering Ram** | Sends the **same payload** to **all positions**. Useful for duplicate field testing (e.g., auth tokens). |
| **Pitchfork**     | Sends **synchronized** payloads from multiple lists to multiple positions.                               |
| **Cluster Bomb**  | Sends **every combination** of payloads across all positions. Ideal for brute-force.                     |

## 🔐 Brute-force Login Example

1. Intercept login request and send to Intruder.
2. Mark `username` and `password` as positions.
3. Select **Cluster Bomb**.
4. Load:

   * A username wordlist (e.g., `usernames.txt`)
   * A password wordlist (e.g., `rockyou.txt`)
5. Analyze response status code, length, or content for successful logins.

---

## 🧰 Payload Options

You can use:

* 📜 Custom Wordlists (`rockyou.txt`, `common.txt`)
* 🔢 Number or character sequences
* 💥 Fuzzing characters
* 🧬 Pre-built payload types (XSS, SQLi, etc.)
* 🧩 Burp Extensions (for advanced payload generation)

---

## 📊 Response Analysis

Monitor these columns in Intruder results:

* **Status** → e.g., 200 OK vs. 403 Forbidden
* **Length** → Response byte size
* **Words** → Word count in response
* **Lines** → Number of lines
* **Grep Match / Grep Extract** → Match known success markers or extract tokens

---

## ⚠️ Notes & Limitations

* 🚫 **Free/Community version** of Burp has rate-limiting for Intruder.
* ⚡ For fast/high-volume attacks, upgrade to **Burp Suite Professional**.
* 🧪 Combine Intruder with **Grep Extract**, **Match & Replace**, and **Macros** for dynamic, token-based attacks.
