# 🔍 What is Burp Suite?

**Burp Suite** is a powerful integrated platform developed by **PortSwigger**, primarily used for **web application penetration testing**. It offers a full range of tools to help security professionals identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

Burp Suite acts as an **intercepting proxy** that sits between your browser and the target application. It allows you to:

* Inspect and modify HTTP(S) traffic on the fly
* Automate scans for common vulnerabilities
* Manually test for complex security issues
* Reproduce and refine attacks like **SQLi**, **XSS**, **CSRF**, etc.

## 📊 Core Tools in Burp Suite

| Tool         | Functionality                                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Proxy**    | Intercepts traffic between browser and server            |
| **Intruder** | Automates customized attacks (fuzzing, brute-force)      |
| **Repeater** | Manually modify and resend HTTP requests                 |
| **Scanner**  | Automatically scans for security issues *(Pro only)*     |
| **Decoder**  | Encodes/decodes/transforms data (Base64, URL, Hex, etc.) |
| **Comparer** | Compares requests/responses to find differences          |
| **Extender** | Adds plugins/extensions (via BApp Store or custom code)  |

---

## ⏳ Typical Workflow

1. Set browser proxy to `127.0.0.1:8080`
2. Start Burp Suite and enable the proxy
3. Intercept requests from browser (e.g., `http://example.com`)
4. Use **Repeater** to modify & replay requests
5. Use **Intruder** to automate payload testing
6. Review results and analyze for vulnerabilities

## 🔐 HTTPS Interception

To intercept HTTPS:

* Install Burp's **CA Certificate** into your browser or OS
* This lets Burp decrypt and inspect HTTPS traffic without security warnings

---

## ⚖️ Use Cases

* Testing login forms
* Discovering hidden parameters
* Exploiting **IDOR**, **SSRF**, and logic flaws
* Performing fuzzing & brute-force attacks
* Auditing REST APIs and endpoints

## 💡 How HTTPS Works

**HTTPS** uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) and **asymmetric encryption**:

| Key Type        | Description                                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Private Key** | Stored securely on server; decrypts data encrypted by public key |
| **Public Key**  | Shared with clients; encrypts data sent to server                |
