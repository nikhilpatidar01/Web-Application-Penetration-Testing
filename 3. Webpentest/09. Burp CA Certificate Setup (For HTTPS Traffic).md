# üîç What is a CA Certificate?

A Certificate Authority (CA) certificate is a trusted certificate that your browser or OS uses to verify secure HTTPS connections. Installing Burp‚Äôs CA certificate allows Burp Suite to decrypt and inspect HTTPS traffic without browser security warnings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Why Install Burp‚Äôs CA Certificate?
- Burp acts as a man-in-the-middle proxy for HTTPS traffi
- Without the CA cert, browsers show security errors when intercepting HTTPS
- Installing the CA cert tells your system/browser to trust Burp‚Äôs proxy

# 1. **Installing Burp CA Certificate on Kali Linux (For System-wide HTTPS Interception)**

### üß≠ **Step 1: Download the Burp Certificate**

1. Launch **Burp Suite**
2. Configure browser to use proxy:
   `127.0.0.1:8080`
3. In the browser, go to:

   ```
   http://burpsuite
   ```
4. Click on `CA Certificate (.der)` to download the file:

   ```
   cacert.der
   ```

---

### üîÑ **Step 2: Convert `.der` to `.crt`**

Convert the downloaded certificate for compatibility with Linux certificate stores:

```bash
openssl x509 -in cacert.der -inform DER -out cacert.crt
```

---

### üóÇÔ∏è **Step 3: Move to Trusted System Certificate Store**

```bash
 cp -v cacert.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
 update-ca-certificates
```

> ‚úÖ You should see:
> `1 added, 0 removed; done.`

---

### üß™ **Step 4: Verify with curl via Burp Proxy**

Check if HTTPS is being intercepted properly:

```bash
curl https://google.com --proxy 127.0.0.1:8080 --cacert /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/cacert.crt
```

> üü¢ If the page loads without SSL errors, your Burp CA is installed correctly!

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Step 5: Use Burp with Tools (e.g., Dirsearch)**

```bash
dirsearch -u https://example.com --proxy 127.0.0.1:8080 --cacert /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/cacert.crt
```

> üí° Some tools may have their own SSL verification settings. Always pass the CA file explicitly if needed.

---

### üßπ **Step 6: Remove the Burp CA (Optional Cleanup)**

If you want to uninstall the certificate:

```bash
 rm -f /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/cacert.crt
 update-ca-certificates --fresh
```

## üîß Chrome Browser Setup

Navigate to:

```
chrome://settings/security
‚Üí Scroll to "Advanced"
‚Üí Disable (OFF) "Always use secure connections"

```

> üîê This ensures Chrome won't force HTTPS upgrades that interfere with interception.

## üí° **How HTTPS Works (Quick Refresher)**

HTTPS = TLS + Public Key Cryptography üîí

| üîë Key Type     | üìÑ Description                                                         |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Private Key** | Stored securely on the server, used to **decrypt** data                |
| **Public Key**  | Shared with clients, used to **encrypt** data before sending to server |

#  2. **How to Manually Install Burp‚Äôs CA Certificate in Chrome (Linux / Kali / Windows)**

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

* You‚Äôve installed **Burp Suite** and have it running
* You‚Äôve configured your browser proxy to `127.0.0.1:8080`

---

### üîΩ **Step 0: Download the Burp CA Certificate**

1. **Launch Burp Suite**

2. Go to the **Proxy** tab ‚Üí **Options** ‚Üí Ensure proxy is running on port `8080`

3. Open your browser (Chrome or Firefox)

4. Navigate to:

   ```
   http://burp
   ```

5. You‚Äôll see a page titled **‚ÄúWelcome to Burp Suite‚Äù**

6. Click on:

   ```
   CA Certificate (.der)
   ```

7. This will download the file:

   ```
   cacert.der
   ```

> üí° If this page doesn‚Äôt load, make sure your browser is set to use Burp‚Äôs proxy (127.0.0.1:8080)

---

### üîπ **Step 1: Convert the Certificate (Optional but Recommended)**

Convert the downloaded `.der` certificate into `.pem` or `.crt`:

```bash
openssl x509 -inform DER -in cacert.der -out burp-ca.pem
```

Or:

```bash
mv cacert.der burp-ca.crt
```

---

### üîπ **Step 2: Open Chrome Certificate Settings**

1. Open **Google Chrome**
2. In the address bar, type:

   ```
   chrome://settings/privacy
   ```
3. Scroll to **Security**
4. Click **Manage Certificates**

> On Windows, this opens Chrome‚Äôs built-in certificate manager
> On Linux, it may open your system‚Äôs certificate tool (like `nss`)

---

### üîπ **Step 3: Import the Burp Certificate**

1. Go to the **Authorities** tab
2. Click **Import**
3. Select your `burp-ca.crt` or `burp-ca.pem` file
4. ‚úÖ Check all 3 trust checkboxes:

   * Trust this certificate to identify websites
   * Trust this certificate for email users *(optional)*
   * Trust this certificate for software makers *(optional)*
5. Click **OK / Import**

---

### üß™ **Step 4: Test HTTPS Interception**

* Restart Chrome
* Open a secure site like `https://example.com`
* If no certificate error shows and Burp captures traffic, üéØ it‚Äôs working!

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Optional: Launch Chrome with Proxy Flags

Great for testing via command line:

```bash
google-chrome --proxy-server="127.0.0.1:8080" --ignore-certificate-errors
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only use `--ignore-certificate-errors` for temporary testing, not for real browsing

---

### üßº Remove Burp‚Äôs Certificate (Optional Cleanup)

Go to:

```
chrome://settings/privacy ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Manage Certificates ‚Üí Authorities
```

Find the Burp cert (e.g., **PortSwigger** or **Burp CA**) and click **Delete**
