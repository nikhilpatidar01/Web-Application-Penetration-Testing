## 🧠 Burp Suite Dashboard 

It helps you test the security of web applications by intercepting, analyzing, modifying, and scanning HTTP/S traffic between your browser and the target web app.

### ✉️ 1. **New Scan > Crawl**

This scan only **discovers links and pages** on a target website. It does **not scan for vulnerabilities**.

#### ✅ Step-by-Step:

1. Open **Burp Suite**.
2. Go to the **Dashboard** tab.
3. Click on the **“New Scan”** button (top-left corner).
4. Choose **“Crawl”** from the scan types.
5. Enter the **Target URL** (e.g., `http://testphp.vulnweb.com`)
6. Click **“OK”** or **“Start scan”** to begin crawling.

#### ⚙️ What happens:

* Burp automatically finds all the internal links and pages.
* These links are shown in the **Target → Site Map** tab.
* Focuses purely on discovering content without running vulnerability checks.
* Follows all links and parameters.
* Ideal for mapping the attack surface before starting manual or selective audits.

> **Tip:** This is great for mapping the application — but it doesn’t find any vulnerabilities.

### ✉️ 2. **New Scan > Crawl and Audit**

This scan **discovers links** and also **audits** the application to find vulnerabilities like XSS, SQLi, etc.

#### ✅ Step-by-Step:

1. Open Burp Suite ➜ Go to the **Dashboard**.
2. Click on **“New Scan”** ➜ choose **“Crawl and Audit”**.
3. Enter the **Target URL**.
4. (Optional) Set scan scope to limit the test to specific folders/pages.
5. Click **“Start Scan”**.

#### ⚙️ What happens:

* First, Burp will **crawl** the app (discover URLs).
* Then it will **audit** all the found items.
* Any issues will appear in the **“Issues” tab** in real-time.
* Combines both crawling and active auditing in a single operation.
* Automatically detects endpoints, links, and parameters.
* Performs vulnerability checks (e.g., XSS, SQLi, etc.) on discovered content.
* Useful for automated end-to-end testing of web applications.

> Great for automatic scanning + finding security bugs quickly 🔍

### 🧭 3. **Audit Selected Items (Manual Audit)**

This lets you manually choose which items (pages/endpoints) you want Burp to audit.

#### ✅ Step-by-Step:

1. Go to the **Target ➜ Site Map** tab.
2. Right-click on any folder or request.
3. Select **“Audit selected items”**.

#### ⚙️ What happens:

* Burp will only audit the items you selected.
* Great for targeted testing of specific pages (e.g., `/admin`, `/login`).

> Perfect for focused scanning without wasting time on non-important pages.

---

### ⏳ 4. **New Live Task > Live Audit**

This is a **real-time scan** that works while you manually explore a website (via browser, Repeater, etc.).

#### ✅ Step-by-Step:

1. Go to **Dashboard** tab.
2. Click on **“New Live Task”**.
3. Select **“Live Audit”**.

#### ⚙️ What happens:

* Burp will audit **every request and response** automatically.
* You just browse or test manually, and Burp does the scanning in the background.

> Super helpful during **manual penetration testing** sessions.

### 🧘‍♂️ 5. **New Live Task > Live Passive Crawl**

This task **discovers endpoints silently** while you browse — **without sending extra requests**.

#### ✅ Step-by-Step:

1. Go to **Dashboard ➜ New Live Task ➜ Live Passive Crawl**.
2. Start browsing your target site using Burp’s browser or your own browser with proxy.
3. Burp will **capture** all pages you visit and **add them to the site map**.

#### ⚙️ What happens:

* Burp collects all visited endpoints but doesn’t actively scan.
* Useful when you want to **stay stealthy** and avoid triggering firewalls/WAFs.
