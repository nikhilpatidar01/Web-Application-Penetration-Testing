# PHP Regular Expressions - Key Functions
Regular expressions (regex) in PHP help you search, replace, or split strings based on patterns. This guide covers three key PHP regex functions: preg_replace(), preg_quote(), and preg_split(). Each section includes simple explanations, sorted examples (from basic to advanced), and practical tips.

## 1. `preg_replace()`

### **Usage**

```php
preg_replace(pattern, replacement, string, limit)
```

### **Description**

Replaces all matches of a pattern in a string with a replacement value.

* `pattern`: The regular expression pattern.
* `replacement`: The value to replace.
* `string`: The input string.
* `limit` *(optional)*: Maximum number of replacements.

### **Example**

```php
<?php
$str = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
$pattern = "/quick|lazy/";
$replacement = "smart";
$result = preg_replace($pattern, $replacement, $str);
echo $result;
// Output: The smart brown fox jumps over the smart dog.
?>
```

---

### **HTML Example – `preg_replace.php`**

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Preg Replace</title>
</head>
<body>
<?php
$str1 = "This course will immerse the student into an interactive environment where they will learn how to test and secure their own system as well as of organization with Ethical Hacking aspects. Students also learn Windows and RHEL servers. The labs' friendly environment gives each student co-op knowledge which exceeds with each person and practical knowledge with the current essential security system. Students then learn how attacks modify privileges and what steps are needed to secure the system. In this course, students will learn Networking Fundamentals, Windows Server Management, Active Directory Domain Services, Group Policy Objects, File Services, Distributed File System, Internet Information Services, FTP, Remote Access.";

$pattern = "/as/i"; // case-insensitive search
$replacement = "AS";

$exp = preg_replace($pattern, $replacement, $str1);
echo $exp;
?>
</body>
</html>
```

**Output:**
Every occurrence of "as", "As", "AS", etc., is replaced with "AS".

## 2. `preg_quote()`

### **Usage**

```php
preg_quote(string, delimiter)
```

### **Description**

Escapes all regex special characters in a string so it can be safely used in a regular expression.

* `delimiter` *(optional)*: The regex delimiter used in the pattern.

### **Example**

```php
<?php
$str = "Hello. How are you?";
$escaped = preg_quote($str, "/");
echo $escaped;
// Output: Hello\. How are you\?
?>
```

---

### **HTML Example – `preg_quote.php`**

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Preg Quote</title>
</head>
<body>
<?php
// Example 1: A string with special characters
$price = "$999.99";
echo preg_quote($price);
echo "<br />";

// Example 2: A URL
$url = "https://www.google.com";
echo preg_quote($url);
echo "<br />";

// Example 3: Using "/" as delimiter
echo preg_quote($url, "/");
echo "<br />";

// Example 4: A string with many special characters
$special_chars = '~!@#$%"8*()_+\"z<>?/.,;\'{}[]';
echo preg_quote($special_chars);
echo "<br />";

// Example 5: Using "a" as delimiter
echo preg_quote($special_chars, "a");
?>
</body>
</html>
```

---

## 3. `preg_split()`

### **Usage**

```php
preg_split(pattern, string, limit, flags)
```

### **Description**

Splits a string into an array using a regex pattern.

* `limit` *(optional)*: Max number of elements in the array.
* `flags` *(optional)*: Can include `PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY`, `PREG_SPLIT_DELIM_CAPTURE`, etc.

### **Example**

```php
<?php
$str = "one,two,,three";
$pattern = "/,/";
$result = preg_split($pattern, $str, -1, PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY);
print_r($result);
// Output: Array ( [0] => one [1] => two [2] => three )
?>
```

---

### **HTML Example – `preg_split.php`**

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Preg Split</title>
</head>
<body>
<?php
// Example 1: Splitting URL by "."
$url = "https://www.google.com";
$split = preg_split("/\./", $url);
echo "<pre>";
print_r($split);
echo "</pre>";

// Example 2: Splitting by "and", limited to 4 splits
$str1 = "This course will immerse the student into an interactive environment where they will learn how to test and secure their own system as well as of organization with Ethical Hacking aspects. Students also learn Windows and RHEL servers. The labs' friendly environment gives each student co-op knowledge which exceeds with each person and practical knowledge with the current essential security system.

$split1 = preg_split("/and/", $str1, 4); // limit to 4 splits
echo "<pre>";
print_r($split1);
echo "</pre>";
?>
</body>
</html>
```
