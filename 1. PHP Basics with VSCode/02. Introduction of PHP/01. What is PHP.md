### ⚖️ Scripting Language vs Programming Language

| Feature                 | Scripting Language                                                                                                             | Programming Language                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**          | A type of programming language designed to automate tasks that could alternatively be executed one by one by a human operator. | A general term for any language used to create software programs that control the behavior of a machine. |
| **Execution**           | Typically interpreted (run line-by-line)                                                                                       | Typically compiled (translated into machine code before running)                                         |
| **Speed**               | Slower (because interpreted)                                                                                                   | Faster (because compiled)                                                                                |
| **Examples**            | PHP, JavaScript, Python *(when used for scripts)*, Ruby, Bash                                                                  | C, C++, Java, Go, Rust                                                                                   |
| **Use Case**            | Web development, task automation, gluing systems together                                                                      | System programming, application development, embedded software                                           |
| **Typical Environment** | Requires an interpreter (like PHP engine, Node.js, Python interpreter)                                                         | Requires a compiler (like `gcc` for C)                                                                   |
| **Complexity**          | Usually simpler, with rapid development focus                                                                                  | More complex, aiming for performance and control                                                         |

### 🔍 Definition

* **Scripting Language**: Automates tasks; usually interpreted
* **Programming Language**: General-purpose; controls machine behavior; usually compiled

### 🏃 Execution & Performance

* **Scripting**: Interpreted → Slower 🐢
* **Programming**: Compiled → Faster 🚀

### 🔍 Examples

* **Scripting**: PHP, JavaScript, Python (scripts), Ruby, Bash
* **Programming**: C, C++, Java, Go, Rust

### 🛠️ Use Case

* **Scripting**: Web dev, task automation, glue systems
* **Programming**: OS, apps, embedded software

### 🖥️ Environment

* **Scripting**: Needs interpreter (e.g., PHP engine, Node.js)
* **Programming**: Needs compiler (e.g., gcc)

### 🔧 Complexity

* **Scripting**: Simpler, fast development
* **Programming**: Complex, more control & performance

### 💬 Summary

* ✅ All scripting languages are programming languages.
* ❌ But not all programming languages are scripting languages.
* 🔄 **Scripting** = automation, quick tasks.
* 🧱 **Programming** = full systems, heavy apps, drivers.

### 📌 Example

* **PHP** → Scripting language (used in web servers)
* **C++** → Programming language (used for OS, games)
