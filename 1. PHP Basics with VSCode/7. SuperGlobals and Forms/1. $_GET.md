# 📘 HTML Forms with GET Method in PHP

The GET method is one of the HTTP request methods used when submitting data from a web form or when fetching data from a server.

This guide demonstrates how to create a basic HTML form using the `GET` method in PHP and how to retrieve submitted form data in the `process-get.php` file.

## 📝 Notes on the GET Method

* 🔓 **URL Exposure** – All form data is appended to the URL as query parameters (e.g., `?key=value&name=abc`).
* 👁️ **Visible in Browser** – Data appears in the browser’s address bar, history, and server logs.
* 🔸 **Best for Non-sensitive Data** – Suitable for search, filters, or navigation.
* ❌ **Not for Passwords or Personal Data** – Avoid using GET for transmitting private information.
* 📏 **Size Limit** – URL length is limited to around 2,048 characters (varies by browser).
* 🔁 **Easily Bookmarked and Shared** – GET URLs can be reused for repeatable actions.

## 🆚 GET vs POST in PHP – One-Line Comparison

| Feature             | GET 🌐                                | POST 📩                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Visibility          | Appended to URL (visible)             | Sent in request body (invisible) |
| Data Limit          | \~2048 characters (browser-dependent) | Practically unlimited            |
| Use Case            | Bookmarks, search, filters            | Sensitive data like passwords    |
| Security            | Less secure (visible in logs)         | More secure (hidden from logs)   |
| Caching/Bookmarking | Can be cached/bookmarked              | Cannot be bookmarked easily      |

## 🧪 Example Files

### ✅ `forms-get.php`

This file contains a **simple login form** using the **GET** method. It is meant for **non-sensitive tasks** like searching or filtering.

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>GET Method Form</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Login Form (GET Method)</h2>

<form action="process-get.php" method="GET">
  Username: <input type="text" name="username" value="" /><br />
  Password: <input type="password" name="passwd" value="" /><br />
  <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Login" />
</form>

<!-- Notes:
 - All data is visible in the URL.
 - Use only for non-sensitive inputs.
 - Do not use GET for passwords or confidential data.
-->

</body>
</html>
```

### 📄 `process-get.php`

This file **receives and displays** data submitted via the **GET** method.

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Process Form</title>
</head>
<body>

<pre>
<?php
print_r($_GET);
?>
</pre>

<?php
$username = $_GET['username'];
$password = $_GET['passwd'];

echo "Username : {$username} <br />";
echo "Password : {$password} <br />";
?>
</body>
</html>
```

## ⚠️ Security Warning

Never use the **GET** method for transmitting sensitive data such as passwords or personal information. GET data is:

* Logged in browser and server logs 📜
* Visible in URLs and may be cached or shared 🌐
* Limited to around 2048 characters 📏

---

## 🧪 Tip for Testing Long Query Strings

Use a tool like **pwgen** to generate a long string and test GET size limitations:

```bash
pwgen 2050 1
```

🔸 Note: The query will likely be **truncated** if it exceeds the GET size limit.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* ✔️ Use **GET** for search forms or URL-based filters.
* ✔️ Use **POST** for login forms or sensitive data submissions.
* ✔️ Always validate and sanitize user input on the server.
