# Scope and Global Variables

**PHP Scope and Global Variables**

PHP variables have different scopes that determine where they can be accessed within a script. Understanding local, global, and static scopes is essential for managing variables effectively and avoiding conflicts or unexpected behaviors.

---

## Types of Scope in PHP

### 1. Global Scope

* Variables declared **outside** of any function are in the global scope.
* These variables are not accessible **directly** inside functions.
* To access them inside a function, you must use the `global` keyword.

### 2. Local Scope

* Variables declared **inside** a function have local scope.
* They are not accessible outside the function in which they are declared.

### 3. Static Scope

* A `static` variable does **not lose its value** when the function exits.
* It retains its value between multiple function calls.

## PHP Code Example

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>PHP Scope and Global Variables Example</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>PHP Scope and Global Variables Example</h2>

<?php
// Global variable
$var1 = "Outside";

function fun1() {
    global $var1;      // Access global variable
    echo $var1 . "<br>";  // Outputs: Outside
    $var1 = "Inside";  // Change global variable
}

fun1();

echo $var1 . "<br>";    // Outputs: Inside


// Local variable example
$var2 = "Outside";

function fun2() {
    $var2 = "Inside";   // Local variable inside function
    return $var2;
}

echo $var2 . "<br>";    // Outputs: Outside (global unchanged)

$var3 = fun2();         // Capture returned value

echo $var3 . "<br>";    // Outputs: Inside (local function value)
?>

</body>
</html>

```
