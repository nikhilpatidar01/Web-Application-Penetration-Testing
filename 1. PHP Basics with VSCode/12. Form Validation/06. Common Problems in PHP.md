## 🧩 Common Problems in PHP

When working with PHP, these are **frequent issues** and their **possible solutions**.

---

### ❌ No Output at All

Check the following:

* ✅ Are you accessing a PHP file (e.g., `.php`) instead of an HTML file?
  👉 Make sure you're visiting PHP files in the browser (not `.html`).

* ✅ Try a simple PHP test page to confirm server configuration:

  ```php
  <?php phpinfo(); ?>
  ```

* ✅ **Typos** — such as misspelled variable names or function names.

* ✅ **Missing semicolons** (`;`) at the end of PHP statements.

* ✅ **Unclosed braces `{}`** — example:

  ```php
  // Missing closing brace
  if (true) {
      echo "Hello";
  // } <-- missing here
  ```

* ✅ **Missing closing quotes (`"` or `'`)** — example:

  ```php
  // Incorrect
  $str = "This is a string;   // <-- missing closing quote

  // Correct
  $str = "This is a string";
  ```

* ✅ **Case-sensitive variable names** — PHP treats them differently:

  ```php
  $myvar = "hello";
  echo $myVar;  // Undefined variable notice
  ```

### ⚙️ Enable Error Reporting

To help identify issues, **enable error reporting**:

1. Edit your PHP configuration file:

   ```bash
   vim /etc/php/7.3/apache2/php.ini
   ```

2. Enable error display by updating the following lines:

   ```ini
   display_errors = On
   error_reporting = E_ALL
   ```

3. Restart Apache after editing:

   ```bash
   systemctl restart apache2
   ```

## 🛑 PHP Error Types

| Type              | Meaning                                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fatal Errors**  | PHP understood the code but couldn't execute it (e.g., undefined function). |
| **Syntax Errors** | PHP couldn't understand the code at all (e.g., missing semicolon or brace). |
| **Warnings**      | PHP found a problem but could continue (e.g., including a missing file).    |
| **Notices**       | PHP offers suggestions or minor alerts (e.g., using an undefined variable). |
