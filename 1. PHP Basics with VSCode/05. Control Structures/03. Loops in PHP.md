## 1. While Loop

### What is a `while` loop?

The `while` loop in PHP executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.

### Use Case:

Use a `while` loop when the number of iterations is **not known** in advance and depends on a condition.

### Full Code Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
$count = 0;
while ($count <= 10) {
    echo $count . ", ";
    $count++;
}

echo "<br />";
echo "Final Count: " . $count;
?>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of Code:

* `$count` is initialized to 0.
* The loop runs as long as `$count` is less than or equal to 10.
* Each iteration prints the value and increments `$count`.

---

## 2. For Loop

### What is a `for` loop?

The `for` loop is used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.

### Use Case:

Use a `for` loop when the number of iterations is **known in advance**.

### Full Code Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>For Loop Example</title>
</head>
<body>

<?php
echo "<h2>PHP For Loop Output (Even or Odd from 0 to 20):</h2>";

for ($i = 0; $i <= 20; $i++) {
    if ($i % 2 == 0) {
        echo "<p>$i is Even.</p>";
    } else {
        echo "<p>$i is Odd.</p>";
    }
}
?>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of Code:

* The loop variable `$i` starts at 0 and ends at 20.
* If `$i` is divisible by 2, it's even; otherwise, it's odd.

## 3. Foreach Loop

### What is a `foreach` loop?

The `foreach` loop is used to iterate over the elements of an array easily.

### Use Case:

Use `foreach` when you want to access **each element** of an array directly without using an index.

### Full Code Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
$array1 = array(20, 25, 78, 45, 96, 21);

// Loop through values
foreach ($array1 as $num) {
    echo $num . ", ";
}
echo "<br>";

// Loop through keys and values
foreach ($array1 as $key => $value) {
    echo "Index $key : Value $value <br>";
}

$users = array(
    'id' => 2,
    'Name' => 'Nikhil',
    'Email' => 'nikhilpatidar132@gmail.com',
    'Password' => 'nikhil@123'
);

// Associative array loop
foreach ($users as $key => $value) {
    echo "$key : $value <br>";
}

// Accessing a single value
echo "User ID: " . $users['id'] . "<br>";

// Conditional check inside loop
foreach ($users as $key => $value) {
    if ($users['id'] == 1) {
        echo "$key : $value <br>";
    }
}
?>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of Code:

* First loop prints all values.
* Second loop prints key-value pairs.
* Third loop checks a condition before printing.

## 4. Break and Continue

### What is `break` and `continue`?

* **`break`**: Exits the loop immediately.
* **`continue`**: Skips the current iteration and jumps to the next one.

### Use Case:

* Use `break` to stop the loop when a condition is met.
* Use `continue` to **skip** unwanted values.

### Full Code Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
echo "<h3>Basic Loop (0 to 10):</h3>";
for ($i = 0; $i <= 10; $i++) {
    echo $i . ", ";
}

echo "<br><h3>Using continue (Skip 5):</h3>";
for ($i = 0; $i <= 10; $i++) {
    if ($i == 5) {
        continue;
    }
    echo $i . ", ";
}

echo "<br><h3>Using break (Stop at 5):</h3>";
for ($i = 0; $i <= 10; $i++) {
    if ($i == 5) {
        break;
    }
    echo $i . ", ";
}
?>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of Code:

* The `continue` skips printing 5.
* The `break` stops the loop completely at 5.

## 5. Array Pointers

### What are Array Pointers?

Array pointer functions in PHP let you manually **navigate** through elements of an array.

### Use Case:

Use when you want **fine control** over the current element's position in an array.

### Full Code Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
$numbers = [100, 200, 300, 400];

echo "Current: " . current($numbers) . "<br>";
echo "Next: " . next($numbers) . "<br>";
echo "Next: " . next($numbers) . "<br>";
echo "Previous: " . prev($numbers) . "<br>";
echo "End: " . end($numbers) . "<br>";
echo "Reset: " . reset($numbers) . "<br>";
?>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of Code:

* `current()` → First element.
* `next()` → Move forward.
* `prev()` → Move backward.
* `end()` → Last element.
* `reset()` → Back to first element.

## 6. Functions

### What is a Function?

A function is a **reusable block of code** that performs a specific task when called.

### Use Case:

Use when a block of logic is reused multiple times with **different inputs**.

### Full Code Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
function square($num) {
    $result = $num * $num;
    echo "Square of $num is $result <br>";
}

square(2);
square(4);
square(6);
?>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of Code:

* `square()` function calculates square of given number.
* Called multiple times with different inputs.
