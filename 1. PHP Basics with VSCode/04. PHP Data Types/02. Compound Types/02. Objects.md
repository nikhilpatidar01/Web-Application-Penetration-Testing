# ðŸ“˜ Objects in PHP  

## ðŸ”¹ What is an Object?

An **object** is a special type of variable that is based on a **class**.

* A **class** is like a **blueprint**.
* An **object** is something you make **from** that blueprint.

ðŸ›  Think of it like this:

* **Class = Plan of a Car**
* **Object = Actual Car built using the plan**

## ðŸ”¸ How to Create a Class

A class is made using the `class` keyword.

```php
class Car {
    // Property (variable inside the class)
    public $color = "Red";

    // Method (function inside the class)
    public function drive() {
        return "Car is driving!";
    }
}
```

## ðŸ”¸ How to Create an Object

We use the `new` keyword to make an object from a class:

```php
$myCar = new Car();
```

---

## ðŸ”¸ How to Access Properties and Methods

We use `->` to access something inside the object.

```php
echo $myCar->color;         // Output: Red
echo $myCar->drive();       // Output: Car is driving!
```

## ðŸ§ª Full Example

```php
<?php
// Step 1: Create a class
class Person {
    public $name = "Nikhil";

    public function greet() {
        return "Hello, my name is " . $this->name;
    }
}

// Step 2: Create an object
$user = new Person();

// Step 3: Use the object
echo $user->name;          // Output: Nikhil
echo "<br>";
echo $user->greet();       // Output: Hello, my name is Nikhil
?>
```
